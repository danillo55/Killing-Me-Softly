Alex: Hey Jamie, did you finish the report?

Jamie: Oh, hey Alex! Yeah, I wrapped it up this morning.

Alex: Great. The client’s going to be happy to hear that.

Jamie: I hope so. They were really pushing for that new layout.

Alex: True. You handled it pretty well though.

Jamie: Thanks. Took a few late nights, but it’s finally done.

Alex: I know that feeling. I barely slept last week finishing my part.

Jamie: You? Not sleeping? That’s new.

Alex: Haha, very funny. I can pull an all-nighter when I have to.

Jamie: Sure, sure. Next time, I’ll believe it when I see it.

Alex: You’ll regret doubting me.

Jamie: Maybe, but I’ll enjoy the show until then.

Alex: Anyway, did you get a chance to look at the new prototype?

Jamie: Yeah, briefly. The controls feel smoother now.

Alex: Good to hear. I reworked the input system last weekend.

Jamie: That explains why the movement feels tighter.

Alex: Exactly. It’s still a bit rough around the edges though.

Jamie: That’s fine. It’s already a big improvement.

Alex: Thanks. I’ll keep tweaking it before the next demo.

Jamie: When’s the demo scheduled again?

Alex: Friday afternoon. We’ll show it to the team first.

Jamie: Got it. I’ll make sure the presentation slides are ready.

Alex: Perfect. Let’s make this one our best build yet.

Jamie: You got it, partner.
